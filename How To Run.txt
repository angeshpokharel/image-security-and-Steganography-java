Hi , good wishes from Angesh.

              This project contain only one program that is steg.java, which is
carrying all the tasks in our project. After run this code, it will get a
window, like u have seen in the media file. 



             In this project our original information will be encrypted in a bit
map file have the extension .bmp. As we know , every BMP format file will have
the dimension of 213 x 205 pixel format. Here we are storing our encrypted
information in that particular Image pixels in the form of Binary digits, now
we got another Image which is dipicted as the orginal Image , but it contains
the encrypted information of our text file. At the time of encrypting and
decryption  we have to give the 16 digit key for security purpose. this
security code is stored in the key1.txt file in our project. 



       Once U go through the project now U can understand every thing , If U
have doubts regarding this contact me at angeshpokharel@gmail.com
